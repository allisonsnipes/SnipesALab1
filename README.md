## Lab1

The purpose of this lab is to simulate an evaluation of an elevator maintained by ABC Corporation. I developed and ran my project in Eclipse IDE, specifically in JDK 8. In order to run the program (1) runtime arguments must be entered into the command line: the file path to the data.txt file, and the file path to the analysis.txt file. Without those two runtime arguments the program will not execute properly. The second file analysis.txt file will be empty until the program writes its output to the file.

I provided a series of test case files entitled: testInput1.txt, testInput2.txt, testInput3.txt, and testInput4.txt. These files were made to make sure that the program ran properly. I accounted for various use cases varying in extreme levels, and random controls I wanted to test for.

### Usage

```bash
java Lab1 input.txt output.txt
```
